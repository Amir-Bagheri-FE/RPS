# rock paper scissors game in JS ✂️
you already know the game. 
i use java script random number in math method for displaying random pic **which is hidden**

---
main part of code was selecting between display or appending child wich because we only have three Element to hide i select display
also removing element each time feels wrong so

---
```javascript
 let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
      cpuSe[random].classList.remove("hidden");
```
### short and easy👌
